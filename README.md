# uva-programming-challenges
Solutions for some programming problems from book *"Programming Challenges: The Programming Contest Training Manual"*.

## About
I'm sharing here some solutions for programming challenges solved while I was undergraduating at UNESP/Bauru (Brazil). At that time, me and some
classmates formed a team to practice for the national Programming Marathon. So, I gathered here the solutions coded in C/C++ for the problems we managed to solve.

The problems we attacked were taken from the book *"Programming Challenges: The Programming Contest Training Manual"*.
All of them are available at the *Universidad de Valladolid (UVA)* Online Judge, available at [http://online-judge.uva.es](http://online-judge.uva.es).

We have subimitted our solutions to the UVA Online Judge and get accepted veredicts in all cases (of course, after some trials =p). You may refer to [my
profiles's page (user ducirilo) at UVA Online Judge](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=20&page=show_authorstats&userid=47683) to see the status of my submissions for these problems.

## Repository's content structure

This repository's content were organized into two subdirectories: 

..* **problems**: stores the statements of the programming problems we solved. Each problem statement is in a PDF file whose name is the problem ID 
in the book *"Programming Challenges: The Programming Contest Training Manual"*.

..* **solutions**: stores de C/C++ source files containing the solutions for the problems we managed to solve. As in the case of statement files, each source code file  
is also named with the problem ID to which it refers.
